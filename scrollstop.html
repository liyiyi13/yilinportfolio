        <h1 class="section-heading">Problem Statement</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">People often lose track of how long they spend doomscrolling, especially on apps designed
            to keep them engaged. Because this behavior is subconscious, users lack the autonomy to stop themselves—even
            when they recognize the negative effects on mood, focus, and productivity. Existing screen-time tools are
            easy to bypass or ignore, leading to ineffective self-regulation. Our goal is to give users intentional,
            interruption-based moments that break the automatic cycle of endless scrolling.
        </p>

        <h1 class="section-heading">Research</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">In order to create an app that effectively intervenes with the doomscroll phenomonon, we
            decided to gather insights as to why doomscroll is such an issue.</p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Primary Research</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">For our primary research, we interviewed 3 participants about doomscrolling. Our
            participants were between the ages of 18-21 and often scroll through their phones. </p>
        <h2 class="sub-sub-heading">Questions</h2>
        <div class="interview">
            <div class="interview-box">
                <h2>Define doomscrolling.</h2>
                <p>" When you are glued to the phone, stuck on social media in a loop of consuming content for
                    hours at a time." - Participant 1

                <h2>How long do you doomscroll?</h2>
                <p>"I usually will doomscroll around 1-2 hours a day" - Participant 1</p>
                <p>"1-2 hours. How long I doomscroll also depends on what I'm doing and if I have a lot to do that day."
                    - Participant 2</p>
                <p>"2-3 hours at the end of the day" - Participant 3</p>

            <div class="interview-box">
                <h2> What are some things you think encourages your doomscrolling? </h2>
                <p> "Well Tiktok in specific is perfect for my short attention span because there is something new every
                    minute. But minutes add up and then I've scrolling for an hour without realizing." - Participant 1
                </p>
                <p>"The videos are entertaining and if they’re boring I can just watch a different video since it’s all
                    so accessible. I think the algorithm just keeps feeding me what I want to see so I keep watching
                    it." - Participant 2"
                </p>
                <p>"It’s just entertainment and a lot of the content I watch distracts me from the monotony of everyday
                    life." - Participant 3</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Secondary Research</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li class="li-styled">
                We found that people ages 18-29 use social
                media the most across platforms like YouTube,
                Instagram, and TikTok.
            </li>
            <li class="li-styled"> Generation Z (1997–2012) also grew up in a
                digital world without a prior experience of a pre-smartphone era, making them true digital natives</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="sub-sub-heading">The Doomscroll Cycle </h2>
        <div class="observation-box">
            <img class="workspace" src="cycle.png" alt="workspace">
            <p class="obs-text">Doomscrolling begins with an internal trigger like stress or boredom, leading to an
                automatic response of opening social media without conscious intent. Users then engage in the behavior
                of endless scrolling, which provides temporary relief through distraction or dopamine. However, this
                results in long-term consequences such as increased anxiety, time loss, and emotional fatigue, creating
                a new trigger that restarts the cycle.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our intervention plans to break this loop by interrupting automatic behavior early and offering
                intentional
                alternatives for relief, helping users pause, reflect, and regain control before doomscrolling becomes
                habitual.
