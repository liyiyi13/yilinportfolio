        <h1 class="section-heading">Introduction</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Booking trips can be stressful for numerous reasons, especially when it comes to finding a
            place to stay. This became a glaring pain point when I was planning my own trip.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">While I was juggling the organization of the trip, I realized how important it is
            to have a website that makes this planning process easier.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            I wanted to see how comfortable and intuitive the website is to use, and whether it is better
            than its competitors. I evaluated this through my tasks that focus on filtering, content
            presentation, and redirection
        </p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Research Question</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Does straying from standard booking site design improve or worsen usability?</p>


        <h2 class="subheading"> Goals and Scope </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The goal is to see how comfortable and intuitive the website is to use, and whether it is
            better
            than its competitors and I evaluate this through my tasks that focus on filtering, content
            presentation, and redirection</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Research Process</h2>
        <h2 class="subheading">Primary Research</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">To start my research, I rounded up 6 websites to look through. All of the websites have a
            purpose in common:
            to help travelers book the perfect acommodation for their trip. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">All 6 websites are listed below.</p>
        <div class="grid">

            <img src="logo-booking-com-png-booking-logo-png-1020.png" alt="">

        </div>
        <p class="paragraph">All six sites followed a similar layout except Trivago, which deviated in three main areas
        </p>
        <ul>
            <strong>
                <li>Filtering and Sorting</li>
                <li>Content Presentation</li>
                <li>Booking Redirection</li>
            </strong>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="subheading">Issue 1: Filtering and Sorting</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Trivago’s sorting system varies from standard hotel booking sites. Instead of clear options
            like <u>“Lowest
                to Highest” or “Highest to Lowest,”</u> <strong>Trivago's site uses</strong> <u>“Price Only” and “Price
                & Recommended”</u> as seen in the left
            photo.
            <br>
            The meaning of these labels is <strong>unclear</strong> — users can’t easily tell which shows the cheapest
            or most expensive
            listings. Additionally, sponsored hotels sometimes appear at the top, <strong> disrupting the order and
                creating
                inconsistency.</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="image-layout">
            <img src="price filtering.png" alt="">
            <img src="price comparison.png" alt="">
        </div>

        <h2 class="subheading">Issue 2: Content Presentation and Layout </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Unlike most booking sites that open hotel details in a new tab, <u>Trivago displays
                information
                in a dropdown
                section</u> on the same page.It results in a <strong>cluttered and
                overwhelming layout.</strong></p>
        <p class="paragraph">The dropdown shares a screen with a map panel. I had to scroll
            extensively to view amenities, pricing, and reviews which was too <strong>overstimulating for</strong> me.
            Additionally,
            Trivago
            disables right-clicking to open listings in new tabs, so I wasn't able to do side by side comparisons.</p>
        <div class="dropdown-box">

            <figcaption>Information about the hotel opens in a dropdown rather than a new tab. </figcaption>
        </div>


        <h2 class="subheading">Issue 3: Redirection</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">The third issue I noticed involves Trivago’s redirection process when booking. Unlike other
            sites, Trivago
            <u>lists deals from multiple booking platforms</u>, highlighting the cheapest option in green. While this
            comparison feature seems helpful, it becomes <strong>confusing</strong> once users click “View Deal.”
            Instead of completing
            the booking on Trivago, they are <strong>redirected</strong> to an external site, which can feel unexpected
            and disrupt the
            user flow.
        </p>


        <p class="paragraph">Because users often overlook the small text showing the third-party site, this redirection
            may seem
            misleading. It also introduces <strong>inconsistencies in prices.</strong> They may differ due to hidden
            fees or room variations not
            reflected on Trivago’s page. This <strong>lack of transparency</strong> weakens trust and makes the
            experience feel less
            seamless.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Overall, the redirection process can be jarring and confusing for users, potentially discouraging them from
            using Trivago again.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph"><strong>[After revisiting the site a year later, I noticed that Trivago has
            introduced a new feature called Trivago Book & Go which allows users to book directly on the site.]</strong> </p>
        <hr>

        <h2 class="section-heading"> User Testing</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">To confirm the issues I noticed, I conducted usability tests with three undergraduate students from Indiana University.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">The participants majored in Marketing, Data Science, and Computer Science. Each participant
            had prior
            experience using
            hotel booking sites but not Trivago specifically. Tests ranged from 9 to 15 minutes</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Tasks and Findings</h2>
        <div class="findings">
            <div class="page-trivago">
                <p><strong>Task 1: Sorting and Filtering</strong></p>
                <p>All three participants were asked to find the cheapest hotel in their destination of choice. After
                    that, they were to find the hotel that was still within their budget</p>
                
                <p> All three users located the price filter easily but struggled with Trivago’s unclear sorting
                    categories.
                    “Price & Recommended” caused confusion, as listings did not appear in the expected order of hight
                    price to low price. None of
                    the
                    participants found a “High–Low” sorting option</p>
                
                <p><em>"It would have been nice if it could consider the recommended thing but also still keep
                        the listings properly sorted by price" - User 1</em>

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="page-trivago">
                <p><strong>Task 2: Content Layout</strong></p>
                <p>The next task was to pick a hotel that they liked and to find information on the amenities and photos
                </p>
                
                <p>When exploring hotel listings, users disliked the dropdown format that presented all information on
                    the same page.
                    They found it cluttered, hard to compare, and visually overwhelming. Two users tried to open details
                    in a new tab
                    but were unable to, which frustrated them.</p>
                
                <p><em>“More modern websites have less details at first until you actually look into it" - User 2</em>
                </p>
                <p><em>"Would one say that this quite a lot? Yes."- User 3</em></p>
            </div>
            <div class="page-trivago">
                <p><strong>Task 3: Redirection</strong></p>
                <p>The third task was that the participants had to book the hotel of their choosing through trivago</p>
                
                <p>When booking, one user didn’t realize clicking “View Deal” would redirect them to a third-party site.
                    Others noticed but still found the redirection unnecessary. The pricing felt inconsistent and
                    misleading as different different
                    prices would appear on the redirected pages.</p>
                
                <p><em>"If it’s just going to take me to Hotels.com, why couldn’t I just go to Hotel.com and
                        search for a hotel in the first place" - User 2</em></p>
            </div>

        </div>
        <h2 class="section-heading">Recommendations</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">After conducting the user tests, I gathered the insights and used them to suggest changes to the Trivago website to ensure better user interaction and ease of use. </p>
        <p class="paragraph"> • Rename sorting categories to “Low–High” and add a“High–Low” option.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> • Open hotel listings in a new tab to reduce clutter and make comparisons easier.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> • Enhance visibility of the redirection message and clearly label external links.</p>
        <p class="paragraph"> • Consider allowing users to book directly through Trivago for a smoother process.</p>
        
 

        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            While Trivago's website is not unusable, I do believe that straying from typical design choices has hurt
            Trivago. My participants and I unanimously agreed that <u>we would never choose Trivago.com
            to browse for and book a hotel over site like Hotels.com or Expedia.com</u>. However, with changes
            to the filters and sort features, content presentation strategies, and streamlining the booking
            process to avoid redirection, Trivago can upgrade to a cleaner, more efficient version of
            themselves that users will go to as their default hotel booking website.
