                <h2 class="subheading">The Problem</h2>
                <p>As companies expand in reach, so does their product line. In return, their production departments
                    should
                    improve and grow to meet increasing demand. This should be the case, however, Epiq Solutions, a
                    Telecommunications company had been struggling with this. While their product demand continued to
                    increase, the production department stayed stagnant and struggled to meet deadlines. Through
                    increased
                    observation, the cause seems to be an outdated and disorganized work process. While there is an
                    attempt
                    at an organized work process, it is forgotten by production employees. </p>

                    <li>Improve production efficiency by reducing time wasted searching for tools and materials.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Implement standardization of processes and workplace organization.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Help production employees easily understand and apply the 5S system in their daily routines.

        <p class="paragraph"> I created an interactive training module that guides the production employees through the
            5
            phases of 5S: Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize and Sustain. The training module includes videos
            lessons,
            module quizzes, progress dashboard and reviews to establish and refresh production employees' 5S mindset.

            <p class="paragraph">In order to establish an effective solution to Epiq’s production issue, I wanted to
                find the root cause
                of
                Epiq’s disorganization.</p>

                <p class="obs-text">To do so, I immersed myself into the environment as if I were an employee myself. I
                    assembled and tested
                    products using tools and materials and following the instructions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was then when the issue was clear
                    to me. The production department had a severe lack of organization and 5S. Because I was not given
                    clear
                    instructions of where to put tools and materials, I found myself tossing them aside or placing them
                    in
                    random places, making it difficult for the next person to find what they are looking for.

                <p> I wanted to focus on making sure my solution was engaging, feasible and simple. A digital training
                    module stood out because it could be updated easily, standardized across teams, and used as both
                    onboarding and refresher material.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> To test the training module, I had the employees try out a draft of what would be the final website.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As the production employees navigated the training module site, I gave them specific tasks

            follow.

            <strong>

                <br>

        <div class="brainstorm-2">
            <div class="page">
                <p>Employees appreciated the structure but requested clearer quiz questions. </p>

        <h1 class="subheading">Tweaks</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Based on feedback, I rewrote confusing quiz questions and introduced
            a feature: in the completed section of the overview page, a button next to the completed module
            will
            take you to that module review page.

        <div class="reflection-left">
            <h2>Design Insight</h2>

                habits through repeated, engaging interactions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="reflection-left">
            <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
            <p> I gained hands-on experience combining UX research with front-end development, bridging

                insights directly into a working product.</p>
