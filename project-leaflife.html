                <p class="page_p">
                    Despite the known benefits of having houseplants, many people often
                    struggle to take care of them effectively. This stems from a lack
                    of knowledge and inconsistent care, leading to neglected and dying plants.

            <h2 class="subheading">Sketches</h2>
            <p class="paragraph"> Through three prototype iterations, I experimented with layout and color variations to
                identify a direction that best balanced visual appeal with intuitive navigation and user accessibility.

            <p class="paragraph">To draw out the sketches, I used Procreate. This would ensure clean and readable
                sketches that I could easily share with the team.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In order to create a visual design that aligned with our theme of plants and growth, I

            <h2 class="subheading">Low-Fidelity Prototype</h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                After discussion, our team decided to develop a low fidelity prototype of <strong>Concept
                    Three</strong>. We did this because we wanted a prototype of the application that we could use to
                out the layout and user interaction before
                committing to the final prototype.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                We chose <strong>Concept Three</strong> because we felt as if its playful color scheme best supported
                the gamified concept and
                helped create a more engaging experience for users.
